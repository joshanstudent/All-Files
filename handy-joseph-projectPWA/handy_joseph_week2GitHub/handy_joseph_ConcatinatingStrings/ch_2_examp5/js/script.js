//declaring three variables


//declare the first variable to a string variable
var greetingString = "Hello";

//declare the second variable to whatever the user wish it to be
var myName = prompt("Please enter your name", "");

//nothing is declare for the third variable because it will be to store the result of the concatenation, later in the code
var concatenation;

//this syntax allow you to write directly into the web page 
document.write(greetingString + "" + myName + "<br>");

concatString = greetingString + "" + myName;

//broadcasting your age in this syntax
