			<p><strong>Bowling</strong> refers to a series of <em>sports</em> or leisure activities in which a player rolls or throws a <em>bowling ball</em> towards a target. In pin bowling variations, the target is usually to knock over <em>pins</em> at the end of a lane. In target variations, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a <em>mark</em> as possible. The pin version of bowling is often played on a flat wooden or other synthetic surface, whilst in target bowling, the surface may be grass, gravel or a synthetic surface. The most common <em>types</em> of pin bowling include <em>ten-pin, nine-pin, candlepin, duckpin</em> and <em>five-pin bowling,</em> while in target bowling, <em>bowls, bocce, carpet bowls, pétanque and boules,</em> both indoor and outdoor varieties, are popular. Today, the sport of bowling is enjoyed by 100 million people in more than 90 countries worldwide.</p>

			<h1 id="history">History</h1>
			<p>The earliest most primitive forms of bowling can be dated back to <em>Ancient Egypt</em> and the <em>Roman Empire.</em> From records and artifacts in ancient Egypt, going back 3000–5000 years ago, remnants of bowls used at the time were found. Balls, made of husks of corn, covered in material such as leather, and bound with string were made. Other balls, made of porcelain, also exist, indicating that these were rolled along the ground, rather than thrown, due to their size and weight. Some of these resemble the modern day jack used in target bowl games of today. Bowls games of different forms are also noted by <em>Herodotus</em> as an invention of the <em>Lydians in Asia Minor.</em> About 2,000 years ago a similar game evolved between Roman legionaries: it entailed tossing stone objects as close as possible to other stone objects (this game became popular with Roman soldiers, and eventually evolved into Italian <em>Bocce,</em> or outdoor bowling).
			The first standardized rules for pin bowling were established in <em>New York City,</em> on September 9, 1895. The oldest surviving bowling lanes in the United States is part of the summer estate of Henry C. Bowen in Woodstock, Connecticut, at Roseland Cottage. The lanes, now part of Historic New England's Roseland Cottage house museum, dates to the construction of the cottage in 1846. It contains Gothic Revival architectural elements, in keeping with the style of the entire estate.
			Rules for target bowls evolved in each of the countries who had adopted the predominantly British based game. In 1905, the International Bowling Board was formed, and it subsequent constitution adopted the Laws of the Scottish Bowling Association, with variations allowed for various regulations at individual country level. The oldest known bowls green for target style bowling is that which is now part of the Southhampton Bowling club, in southern England. The use of the land as an area for recreational bowls dates back to 1299, and was then known as the <q>Master's Close</q>.
			Today, bowling is enjoyed by 95 million people in more than ninety countries worldwide and continues to grow through entertainment media such as video games for home consoles and handheld devices.</p>
